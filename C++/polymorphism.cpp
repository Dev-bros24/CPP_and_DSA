/* 
Polymorphism
1. Compile time polymorphism  --> Function and operator overloading
Predecided that which function will be called for which object's function call
--> objects get binded to the functions that for which object which functions will be 
called.
--> code dekh kar compiler decide karke baitha hota hai ki kaun sa function run
hona hai

--> Linking is done in compile time only. 
This is called early and static binding
also.

2. Runtime Polymorphism --> Virtual functions
Runtime pe decide(bind) hota hai ki kaun sa function kis object ke saath run kiya
jaaye. Wo decide hota hai pointer ke type ko dekh kar.
This is called late binding also.
